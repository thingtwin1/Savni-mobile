	<p> When I was young, I participated in many activities. I did ballet for 1 year, but then I quit. 
I went to swimming classes, but then I moved. I used to participate in dance at my elementary school,
but then I went to middle school. I joined student council and scrapbooking club in middle school, but those clubs were 
not there in high school. I joined dance again, but then I twisted my knee so I stopped. 
I joined swimming classes again and relearned how to swim, but I didn't have anytime to got to class anymore.I played some badminton, took some lessons, and joined the badminton team, but I stopped because my knee hurt again.
I enjoyed cooking so I bake when I have free time, but I have too many activites so I don't have any time. I volunteered in the summer at a hospital, but there volunteer program was only during the summer. 
I have done many sports, clubs and classes but I haven't done anything like GWC before.</p>

<h1> This painting was made by Savni Nagarkar </h1>
	<p>This painting was made as a class project. Ellen and I created a code 
	that would let anybody make their own Jackson Pollock style painting. The 
	user can drag their mouse and the computer will make a painting for you. Every 
	time you create a painting it will be different that before. I liked this project 
	because the final product looked really nice. </p>
